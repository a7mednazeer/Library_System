IS101 is a project that focuses on the development of a Library System using SQLs and Microsoft Access. The system will allow users to store, manage, and access library information such as books, authors, publishers, and patrons. It will also provide features such as book search, book checkout/return, and patron management. The system will be designed to be user-friendly and secure. It will also be able to integrate with other systems such as online databases for easy access to library resources. The project will use SQLs and Access to create the database structure and store the data. It will also use programming languages such as Java, PHP or C# to create the user interface. The project is expected to take approximately 1 months to complete.
